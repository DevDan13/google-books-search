## Description
The google books search MERN lets you easily search for books at your convinience.  It allows you to further view those books by clicking the view button, which takes you to the google book's page where you may find more information on it or purchase it.

There are many packages to install which can be viewed in the package.json.  please view it and remove any you do not need, then run the following command in your terminal.  Please do this in both the client folder, as well as the main project repository.

```bash

```
## Usage 
Use the search bar by typing the book you wish to find then click search.  Books will populate the page for your viewing and reading pleasure.  Click on view to be taken to that book's page on google books, or click saved to save the book in our database for a later viewing! Free of charge of course.

## Test
Once saved to our database test this by clicking over to tthe saved page.  Your book will appear there exactly as it had appeared in our search page.  The book now will have an option to be viewed as the previous page had, but also a button to delete it from our database.  The delete button will remove the book from this page, but can still be searched for in our search page again if accidents happen.  Try saving a book by clicking on save, then deleting the saved book by clicking the header button to the saved page and click delete to clear your book list!
